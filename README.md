Autocurry
=========

Currying is a powerful technique in functional programming languages like Haskell. This decorator allows a function to 
be automatically curried by supplying fewer arguments than required.

### Installation
```
pip3 install autocurry
```

### Usage
```python
from autocurry import autocurry

@autocurry
def find_by_key_with_connection(db_connection, key):
    ...
    
find_by_key = find_by_key_with_connection(some_connection)

value1 = find_by_key('my_key')
value2 = find_by_key('your_key')
```
